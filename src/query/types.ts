/**
 * Values acceptable on the right-hand side of an ordering or equality
 * comparator against a column of the given Type. Three forms:
 *   - a raw value of the column's TS type (becomes a Parameter);
 *   - another Column whose TS type and SQL tag match (so `int4 = int4`
 *     works but `int4 = text` does not);
 *   - an Expression whose result matches the column's TS type.
 *
 * NULL is not accepted here. Use `.isNull()` / `.isNotNull()` instead;
 * the SQL `=` and `<>` operators do not behave as null-checks.
